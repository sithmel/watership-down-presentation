            Hi, today I am going to talk about teams and teamwork. That's an unusual subject for me.
            But I had the chance last year to do some interesting readings about that. And I want to share my findings
            I found a lot of connections between a literature work and other books I was reading. The book is:
            "Watership down"
            Watership Down is a fantasy adventure novel by English author Richard Adams, published in 1972.
            The story features a small group of rabbits with their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology.
            The novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home,
            encountering perils and temptations along the way.

            This is how everything starts:
            Fiver, a young rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction.
            When he and his brother Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate,
            they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them.

            The newly formed warren finds a river on its way.
            Hazel knows that the other rabbits may not want to cross the river, but Fiver tells him that they must.
            Bigwig (which is the strongest rabbit) comes hurrying back to tell them
            that there is a dog loose in their wood.
            Hazel realizes they must get across, but Pipkin (a weak but resourceful rabbit) is hurt
            and will not be able to swim.
            Blackberry (the smartest rabbit) figures out a way to float Fiver and Pipkin on a piece of wood,
            and they all get across safely.

            But the field is already inhabited by a group of rabbits, who seem strange but let the travelers stay with them.
            Fiver warns the rabbits not to join the new warren, but they do not listen to him because the living is easy and
            there is food for everyone.
            There is something odd about the warren, but they cannot figure out what it is.
            Finally, after an argument with Fiver, Bigwig gets caught in a snare.

            Fiver figures it all out, explaining to the group that a farmer leaves the food behind
            for the rabbits in order to fatten them up before he catches them in his snares. They decide to leave
