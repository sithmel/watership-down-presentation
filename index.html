            Hi, today I am going to talk about teams and teamwork. That's an unusual subject for me. But I had the chance last year to do some interesting readings about that. And I want to share my findings
            I found a lot of connections between a literature works and other essays I was reading. The book is:
            "Watership down"
            Watership Down is a fantasy adventure novel by English author Richard Adams, published in 1972. The story features a small group of rabbits with their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology. The novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home, encountering perils and temptations along the way.

            This is how everything starts:
            Fiver, a young rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction.
            When he and his brother Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate, they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them.

            I am going to follow the evolution of these newly formed warren as example of a new team

            Just like this new warren, a group of individuals are not a team. But they can develop to be a team.

            Hazel knows that the other rabbits may not want to cross the river, but Fiver tells him that they must. Bigwig wants to know what they are going to do, and Blackberry convinces him to swim across and take a look at the other side to make sure it is safe. Bigwig comes hurrying back to tell them that there is a dog loose in their wood. Hazel realizes they must get across, but Pipkin is hurt and will not be able to swim. Blackberry figures out a way to float Fiver and Pipkin on a piece of wood, and they all get across safely. Blackberry's discovery mystifies all of the other rabbits except Fiver, who understands what happened.
            Hazel does his best to lead the other rabbits, and though he is generally successful, he sometimes he comes up against obstacles that he cannot tackle. He knew that he needs to get the group across the river, but he is not sure if Pipkin can make it. Blackberry's idea saves the day, and even though Hazel does not understand what Blackberry intends, he is still more than willing to try it, especially since he has no ideas of his own. Hazel is the leader, and he takes risks in order to protect the othersâ€”he is not leader because he bullies the others. He is the leader because he knows how to best use each of the others and because he understands how the group functions.
            Hazel is the innovator, during the journey tries to befriend a mouse and a Seagull. That was unthinkable for the

            Fiver warns the rabbits not to join the new warren, but they do not listen to him because the living is easy and there is food for everyone.
            There is something odd about the warren, but they cannot figure out what it is.
            Finally, after an argument with Fiver, Bigwig gets caught in a snare. Hazel and the other rabbits manage to get him out, although they get no help from the rabbits who live in the warren.
            Fiver figures it all out, explaining to the group that a farmer leaves the great food behind for the rabbits in order to fatten them up before he catches them in his snares. They decide to leave

					  <p>Efrafa</p>
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            The expedition comes back roughed up, describing Efrafa as a horrible warren run by a militaristic warlord, General Woundwort.
            Hazel decides that they must go to Efrafa and get some does, because otherwise they will not survive. He has Blackberry come up with a plan, and then the group sets off, leaving behind a few rabbits at the warren.
            Hazel is attempting to do something extremely difficult, and he hopes to be able to do it by utilizing all of the rabbits' resources to the fullest. Blackberry will provide the plan, Bigwig the strength and daring, Kehaar the element of surprise, Fiver the guidance, and Hazel the coordination and leadership. The fact that Hazel gets the warren to agree to the mission against Holly's wishes indicates Hazel's charisma and the esteem with which the rest of the warren holds him.
            Hazel wants all the rabbits to simply run away before the fox gets close, but Bigwig runs off on his own. No one would ever question Bigwig's loyalty, but he sometimes acts of his own accord, which that can be both dangerous and advantageous. It is important that someone other than Hazel is able to seize the initiative, as Hazel cannot always be everywhere at once and sometimes needs others to make decisions. However, the downside is that when Hazel plans on doing one thing, Bigwig may do something else and upset the plan. Bigwig is not really ever in danger with the fox, but one of the three strange rabbits is killed because of his actions. Hazel is upset with Bigwig for taking an unnecessary risk, which demonstrates the major difference in their personalities. Hazel thinks of a fox as a risk, and he wants to get the entire group out of the area before anything can go wrong. Bigwig sees the fox as an animal that cannot hurt him if he is careful, so he acts accordingly. Hazel, however, acts with the safety of the group in mind, while Bigwig simply acts on his own. Bigwig would not be as effective a leader as Hazel because of his tendency to take rash actions like play with the fox. However, this also means that Bigwig can go and do things that Hazel himself cannot afford to do.
            Along with Blackberry, they sneak to a hiding place close to Efrafa, at which time Bigwig enters the warren, pretending to be a solitary rabbit. He finds a doe, Hyzenthlay, who helps him set up a plan to escape. With the help of Kehaar and his own strength and cunning, Bigwig engineers a masterful escape, and the whole groups flees on a boat just as General Woundwort is about to attack them. However, on the way back to Watership Down, a patrol from Efrafa bumps into them, and Captain Campion tracks them and finds their warren. Soon after they return, a mouse whom Hazel had earlier saved brings him news that there is a large number of rabbits close by. They realize that the Efrafans have brought a large force to destroy them.
            Hazel immediately sets the rabbits to work preparing to defend the warren. They bury themselves in and prepare to fight off the invaders, even though they know it will likely cost them their lives. Hazel gets a flash of inspiration and runs off with Dandelion and Blackberry to try to release the dog from the farmhouse and get him to attack the Efrafan rabbits. Meanwhile, Bigwig faces Woundwort in a tremendous battle. Woundwort is bigger and stronger than any other rabbit, but Bigwig defeats him, and soon afterward the dog comes and scatters the Efrafan forces. A cat catches Hazel, but the girl who lives at the farm saves the rabbit and lets him go.
            The rabbits live happily in their warren and Campion returns to run the Efrafan warren. They decide to build a third warren halfway between the two and fill it with rabbits from each warren. Hazel lives several years, longer than most rabbits live, and he sees the warren prosper and thrive before he dies.          </aside>

					<p>Institutional leader</p>

            The institutional leader, being appointed by the organisation, is responsible for the team output, and for the goals and resources.
            They should point to be a natural leader in at least one area (competence, communication, ability to take care of team members). Then delegate the other for of leadership to the natural leaders.
            Failure to do so, and the group won't recognise the role.
            A strong leader can lead the team to a state of lack of self responsibility. From the member point of view, every failure is the leader fault, every success is because of them. The opposite for the leader.          </aside>
