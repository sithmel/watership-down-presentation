            Hi, today I am going to talk about teams and teamwork.
            <br>
            <br>
            ...Introduce yourself...
            <br>
            <br>
            A couple of years ago I was asked to manage my first team as principal engineer.
            After a short while I was helping out 2 teams dealing with different projects/areas.
            <br>
            Despite having 20 odd years of experience in engineering, I realised I didn't have much experience in leading people.
            <br>
            So I decided to do some reading.

            And I found this model applies very well to Watership Down.
            <br>
            Watership Down is a fantasy adventure novel by English author Richard Adams, published in 1972.
            <br>
            The story features a small group of rabbits with their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology.
            <br>
            The novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home,
            encountering perils and temptations along the way.
            <br>
            <br>
            What I am going to do now, is to pick up some episode from the book and show you many different lens we can use to observe a team.
            <br>
            Without further ado, let's see how we can read the story in this new light.

            When he and his brother Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate,
            they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them.

            This new group of rabbits sets on a journey to find a new home.
            <br>
            It is a dangerous situation: rabbits have numerous natural predators; foxes, weasel etc.
            Their survival strategy is to run and hide in their holes, but they can't because they are far from their old home.
            <br>
            <br>
            But they are a group of resourceful rabbits.
            <br>
            Hazel realizes how difficult the situation is, and does his best to take care of the smallest and more vulnerable rabbits.
            <br>
            There is Bigwig, the strongest rabbit, that goes patrolling the area, to check if it is safe.
            <br>
            Dandelion helps conforting the rabbits, telling them stories.
            <br>
            Blackberry, the smartest rabbit, figures out a way to float the rabbits on a piece of wood, and to cross a river safely.

            But the field is already inhabited by a group of rabbits, who seem strange but let the travelers stay with them.

            Fiver warns the rabbits not to join the new warren, but they do not listen to him because the living is easy and
            there is food for everyone.

            There is something odd about the warren, but they cannot figure out what it is.
            <br>
            Finally, after an argument with Fiver, Bigwig gets caught in a snare.
            <br>
            Fiver figures it all out, explaining to the group that a farmer leaves the food behind
            for the rabbits in order to fatten them up before he catches them in his snares. They decide to leave

            You need to take into consideration the participants and context. For example using jargon, technical words, idioms etc.
            Every team develop is own jargon but we need to be aware of it, otherwise it is going to isolate our team from the others.
            In an international team we need to consider how cultures influence the way we communicate.
            The role is also very important.
