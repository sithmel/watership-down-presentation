Hi, today I am going to talk about teams and teamwork. That's an unusual subject for me.
But I had the chance last year to do some interesting readings about that. And I want to share my findings
I found a lot of connections between a literature work and other books I was reading. The book is:
"Watership down"
Watership Down is a fantasy adventure novel by English author Richard Adams, published in 1972.
The story features a small group of rabbits with their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology.
The novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home,
encountering perils and temptations along the way.

This is how everything starts:
Fiver, a young rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction.
When he and his brother Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate,
they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them.

A group of individuals are not a team.

The goal

5
The newly formed warren finds a river on its way.
Hazel knows that the other rabbits may not want to cross the river, but Fiver tells him that they must.
Bigwig (which is the strongest rabbit) comes hurrying back to tell them
that there is a dog loose in their wood.
Hazel realizes they must get across, but Pipkin (a weak but resourceful rabbit) is hurt
and will not be able to swim.
Blackberry (the smartest rabbit) figures out a way to float Fiver and Pipkin on a piece of wood,
and they all get across safely.

6
Different roles are emerging in this group of rabbits.

7
Some member can cover more than one area. Unhealthy teams miss one of them or let the leader to cover all
In a team a person discover their real value, through the difference with the other members.
An unhealthy team tries to suppress that.

8
The rabbits go through several adventures before Hazel successfully brings them
to a field where they believe they can live.
But the field is already inhabited by a group of rabbits, who seem strange but let the travelers stay with them.
Fiver warns the rabbits not to join the new warren, but they do not listen to him because the living is easy and
there is food for everyone.
There is something odd about the warren, but they cannot figure out what it is.
Finally, after an argument with Fiver, Bigwig gets caught in a snare.

Fiver figures it all out, explaining to the group that a farmer leaves the food behind
for the rabbits in order to fatten them up before he catches them in his snares. They decide to leave

Managing conflicts


10
Another rabbit is joining from the previous colony
Two survivors from their home warren,
find the rabbits and tell them of a horrible poisoning that occurred.

The rabbits travel on until they reach Watership Down. At the top there is a perfect field for a rabbit warren.
They settle down in the field, but then Hazel realizes that they need does (female rabbits) to mate with,
as they have only bucks and their warren will not last long without does.


11
Emerging team characteristics
Openess - closeness: how neat is the boundaries of the team?
cohesion - conformity: do we share the same things ?
interdependence - independence: how much we depend each other?
Fragmentation - unity: can we recognise subgroups in the team?
Specialisation: are we able to cover all necessary roles?
Integration - do we accept each other ideas?



12
Kehar
The rabbits befriend a wounded bird, Kehaar,
and after he heals he searches for other warrens so they can get some does.


13
In communication, everything you say is interpreted. It is put in relation with the role of the speaker,
and with the listener
You need to take into consideration the participants and context. For example using jargon, technical words, idioms etc.


14
Kehaar finds some rabbits living in the farm next to the down.
Hazel sets up a raid to free the rabbits in the farm.
They get three of the four rabbits out, although Hazel
is badly injured and thought dead until Fiver goes back and saves him.


15
One or more leaders are chosen by the team based on their competence,
communication skills, ability to take care of team members. They can change over time,
as they are the result of a negotiation.
They are chosen when the members feel the necessity to be led.
The istitutional leader is not enough for covering all team needs.


16
Kehar founds a big overcrowded warren a few miles of distance. Hazel decide to send an expedition.
The expedition comes back roughed up, describing Efrafa as a horrible warren run by a militaristic warlord,
General Woundwort.
Hazel decides that they must go to Efrafa and get some does, because otherwise they will not survive.
He has Blackberry come up with a plan, and then the group sets off,
leaving behind a few rabbits at the warren.
Hazel is attempting to do something extremely difficult,
and he hopes to be able to do it by utilizing all of the rabbits' resources to the fullest.
Blackberry will provide the plan,
Bigwig the strength and daring,
Kehaar the element of surprise,
Fiver the guidance,
and Hazel the coordination and leadership.


17
The institutional leader, being appointed by the organisation,
is responsible for the team output, and for the goals and resources.


18
They should point to be a leader in at least one area (competence, communication, ability to take care of team members). Then delegate the other for of leadership to the natural leaders.
Failure to do so, and the group won't recognise the role.
A strong leader can lead the team to a state of lack of self responsibility.
From the member point of view, every failure is the leader fault,
every success is because of them. The opposite for the leader.
